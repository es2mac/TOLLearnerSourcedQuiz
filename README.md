# Learnersourced Quiz

Live page: [TBD](https://es2mac.github.io/TOLLearnerSourcedQuiz/dist/)

This is Project 3 for the 2020S Tools for Online Learning. Designed and implemented by Ember, Carol and Paul.

The Vue app displays data from the `data.js` file that loads the question set as a global variable. `data.js` is generated by the separately submitted Jupyter notebook. To show a different set of questions, replace the `data.js` file.
