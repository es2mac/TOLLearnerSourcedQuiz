# Cooperative Learning: How Does Sunblock Work?

Live page: [Cooperative Sunblock](https://es2mac.github.io/TOLCooperativeSunblock/dist/)

This is Project 2 for the 2020S Tools for Online Learning. Designed and implemented by Ember, Carol and Paul.

A simple Express server with socket.io is used to assign two learners to different instructional contents. The learners are expected to work together synchronously, going through the units at the same time and do a small discussion after each section. This could be an in-person setting, or online using tools such as Zoom.
